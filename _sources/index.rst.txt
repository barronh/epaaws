Welcome to epaaws's documentation!
==================================

`epaaws` is a library of functions to facilitate analysis of EPA's data on
AWS S3 buckets thru Amazon's Registry of Open Data.[1]_ At present, this only
includes the epa-2022-modeling-platform (see module mp2022). For more
information, see the examples that include installation instructions.
